The purpose of the UDS Client Message Management Library is to provide a robust and efficient solution for handling Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) messages on a Controlled Area Network (CAN). UDS is a standardized diagnostic communication protocol widely used in the automotive industry for vehicle diagnostics and maintenance. This library aims to simplify the implementation of UDS client functionality on CAN-enabled devices, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate UDS communication into their applications.

## Scope
The UDS Client Message Management Library is designed to encompass the following key features and functionalities:
1. **Message Encoding and Decoding:**
   - Encode UDS request messages for various diagnostic services.
   - Decode UDS response messages to extract relevant diagnostic information.
2. **CAN Communication:**
   - Establish and manage communication over the CAN bus.
   - Support standard and extended CAN identifiers.
3. **Session and Security Handling:**
   - Implement UDS session management for multi-step diagnostic operations.
   - Integrate security mechanisms, such as seed-key exchange, as required.
4. **Error Handling and Reporting:**
   - Detect and handle communication errors, ensuring reliable UDS message exchange.
   - Provide detailed error reporting for diagnostics and debugging purposes.
5. **Configuration and Customization:**
   - Allow configuration of CAN communication parameters (e.g., baud rate, message format).
   - Provide flexibility for customization to adapt to different UDS implementations.
6. **Diagnostic Service Support:**
   - Support a broad range of UDS diagnostic services as defined in the ISO 14229 standard.
   - Facilitate easy integration of new diagnostic services.
7. **Compatibility and Compliance:**
   - Ensure compliance with ISO 14229 standards for UDS communication.
   - Provide compatibility with various CAN hardware and software platforms.
8. **Documentation and Examples:**
   - Include comprehensive documentation for the library API and usage guidelines.
   - Provide illustrative examples to assist developers in implementing UDS clients.
By addressing these aspects, the UDS Client Message Management Library aims to offer a reliable and versatile toolset for developers working on CAN-enabled systems requiring UDS communication for diagnostic purposes.
